# AGENTS — ztree-parse-md

Operating rules for humans + AI.

## Workflow

- Never commit to `main`/`master`.
- Always start on a new branch.
- Only push after the user approves.
- Merge via PR.

## Commits

Use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/).

- fix → patch
- feat → minor
- feat! / BREAKING CHANGE → major
- chore, docs, refactor, test, ci, style, perf → no version change

## Releases

- Semantic versioning.
- Versions derived from Conventional Commits.
- Release performed locally via `/create-release` (no CI required).
- Manifest (if present) is source of truth.
- Tags: vX.Y.Z

## Repo map

- `src/` — Zig source code (planned: `root.zig` with public API and implementation)
- `DESIGN.md` — architecture spec: two-pass parser design, memory model, build plan

## Merge strategy

- Prefer squash merge.
- PR title must be a valid Conventional Commit.

## Definition of done

- Works locally.
- Tests updated if behaviour changed.
- CHANGELOG updated when user-facing.
- No secrets committed.

## Orientation

- **Entry point**: `src/root.zig` — public `parse()` function
- **Domain**: GFM Markdown parser that produces a ztree `Node` tree (zero-copy, arena-allocated)
- **Language**: Zig
